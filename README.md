This is a final project developed for the Object-Oriented Programming course, aiming to create a flow for a client. The flow's name can be entered, and information such as the creation date, duplicates, and errors within the flow can be determined. Additionally, the flow can be deleted. Details for each specific flow can be provided, and a selection of 10 steps can be made to include in the flow. Moreover, certain steps can be skipped, and incomplete steps can be left untouched. During execution, the steps taken for the flow are displayed, showing exactly which steps were traversed. When running a flow, steps to be included are chosen, and the information received from these steps is automatically written to the selected file. For example, when testing the code and running a flow, I chose the file "flow.csv" as the one in which I wanted the information to appear. The program then inputted the data into the file as I provided it from the keyboard during the runtime.
